## Native Android app for the Escale platform

Software engineering final project. It consisted in the design, development and implementation of a mobile platform
called Escale, which aims to be the digital support of a new diet plan with remotemonitoring, which will allow patients 
to measure their body composition data from the comfort of home , see statistics and forecasts about its evolution,
get the diet to be made on their phones and communicate with the doctor through a chat. 

In turn, all data collected 
locally by patients will be immediately uploaded to a private server in the cloud, so that the doctor can see, evaluate 
and react early if he notices that a patient needs to correct the course to achieve the goals previously set.

It is worth mentioning that, because the application has a personalized alarm system, the doctor will not be forced
to check frequently if there are people who are not being weighed or if there are inconsistencies between the evolution
of a patient and the assigned plan; on the contrary, the doctor will be notified automatically when situations that
require his attention arise.
